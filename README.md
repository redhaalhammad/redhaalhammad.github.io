# Portfolio Website

For my portfolio website, I wanted to create something that linked my personal photographic practice with (what will hopefully be) my professional practice. 
To do this, I used my personal website as a visual and structural reference when approaching this new site. 
This also informed the decision to link my personal website into my portfolio site, as well as including a self-portrait on the landing and about pages. 
These inclusions provide a more personal element to the site despite its minimal design. 

# Design

To maintain consistency with my preexisting personal site, and to avoid distracting from the content itself, I decided to opt for a monotone color palette with a 
sans-serif typeface. Moreover, pages are minimally occupied with content in order to avoid the cluttered look that was present in my previous projects.
These choices indicate a sleek and contemporary demeanor that I want my work to embody. 
The landing page features a self-portrait that occupies the page's background, creating an intruiging first impression when users first enter the site. 
Structurally, I maintained a conventionally consistent navigation bar featured at the top of each page which enables users to easily navigate between the pages. 

# Key Points in the Code

This projects involved many improvements and streamlined processes from my previous attempts at coding a site myself. 
The main improvement in my workflow was the use of the CSS framework Bootstrap which allowed me to style the site more efficiently due its built-in layouts and components.
I believe that this also contributed in the cleaner design of this site compared to my previous attempts the measurements of the layouts (padding, borders) were standardized.
Moreover, restructuring the different folders in my repository allowed me to access and call different files (index.html or image files) a lot easier.
In terms of JavaScript, I incorporated a button on the about page which allows users to share the site directly from their device to different platforms.

# Improvements

After finishing the site, I realized that the JavaScript code (based on documentation I found on MDN) is not compatible with all browsers.
Going forward, I would ensure the compatibility of all features before including them so different users have consistent experiences based on their browser preferences.
Although I like the mininmal design, I do feel as though smaller details could have been added to emphasize the sleek and contemporary design. 
An example of this could have been an onMouseOver event that changes the shading/opacity of something (e.g an image or text).
